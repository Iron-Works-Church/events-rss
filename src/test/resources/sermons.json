Go down and buy grain for us there, that we may live and not die.\u201D 3 So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. 4 But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers, for he feared that harm might happen to him. 5 Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</p><p>6 Now Joseph was governor over the land. He was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground. 7 Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke roughly to them. \u201CWhere do you come from?\u201D he said. They said, \u201CFrom the land of Canaan, to buy food.\u201D 8 And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. 9 And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them. And he said to them, \u201CYou are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.\u201D 10 They said to him, \u201CNo, my lord, your servants have come to buy food. 11 We are all sons of one man. We are honest men. Your servants have never been spies.\u201D</p><p>12 He said to them, \u201CNo, it is the nakedness of the land that you have come to see.\u201D 13 And they said, \u201CWe, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more.\u201D 14 But Joseph said to them, \u201CIt is as I said to you. You are spies. 15 By this you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here. 16 Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. Or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies.\u201D 17 And he put them all together in custody for three days.</p><p>18 On the third day Joseph said to them, \u201CDo this and you will live, for I fear God: 19 if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined where you are in custody, and let the rest go and carry grain for the famine of your households, 20 and bring your youngest brother to me. So your words will be verified, and you shall not die.\u201D And they did so. 21 Then they said to one another, \u201CIn truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us and we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.\u201D 22 And Reuben answered them, \u201CDid I not tell you not to sin against the boy? But you did not listen. So now there comes a reckoning for his blood.\u201D 23 They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them. 24 Then he turned away from them and wept. And he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes. 25 And Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, and to replace every man's money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. This was done for them.</p><p>26 Then they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed. 27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack. 28 He said to his brothers, \u201CMy money has been put back; here it is in the mouth of my sack!\u201D At this their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, \u201CWhat is this that God has done to us?\u201D</p><p>29 When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying, 30 \u201CThe man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us and took us to be spies of the land. 31 But we said to him, \u2018We are honest men; we have never been spies. 32 We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.\u2019 33 Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, \u2018By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your households, and go your way. 34 Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men, and I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.\u2019\u201D</p><p>35 As they emptied their sacks, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. 36 And Jacob their father said to them, \u201CYou have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin. All this has come against me.\u201D 37 Then Reuben said to his father, \u201CKill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.\u201D 38 But he said, \u201CMy son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is the only one left. If harm should happen to him on the journey that you are to make, you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.\u201D</p><p>\u00A0</p></div></div></div></div></div>",

And Pharaoh awoke. 5 And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time. And behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk. 6 And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind. 7 And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. 8 So in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was none who could interpret them to Pharaoh.</p><p>9 Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, \u201CI remember my offenses today. 10 When Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, 11 we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own interpretation. 12 A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream. 13 And as he interpreted to us, so it came about. I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged.\u201D</p><p>14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the pit. And when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh. 15 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201CI have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.\u201D 16 Joseph answered Pharaoh, \u201CIt is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.\u201D[<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1212a\">a</a>] 17 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201CBehold, in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile. 18 Seven cows, plump and attractive, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass. 19 Seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt. 20 And the thin, ugly cows ate up the first seven plump cows, 21 but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as ugly as at the beginning. Then I awoke. 22 I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good. 23 Seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them, 24 and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.\u201D</p><p>25 Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, \u201CThe dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. 26 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one. 27 The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine. 28 It is as I told Pharaoh; God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do. 29 There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt, 30 but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land, 31 and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of the famine that will follow, for it will be very severe. 32 And the doubling of Pharaoh's dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it about. 33 Now therefore let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt. 34 Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land and take one-fifth of the produce of the land[<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1230b\">b</a>] of Egypt during the seven plentiful years. 35 And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. 36 That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine.\u201D</p><h3>Joseph Rises to Power</h3><p>37 This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants. 38 And Pharaoh said to his servants, \u201CCan we find a man like this, in whom is the Spirit of God?\u201D[<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1234c\">c</a>] 39 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201CSince God has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are. 40 You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command.[<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1236d\">d</a>] Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you.\u201D 41 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201CSee, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.\u201D 42 Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck. 43 And he made him ride in his second chariot. And they called out before him, \u201CBow the knee!\u201D[<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1239e\">e</a>] Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt. 44 Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201CI am Pharaoh, and without your consent no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.\u201D 45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah. And he gave him in marriage Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.</p><p>46 Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt. 47 During the seven plentiful years the earth produced abundantly, 48 and he gathered up all the food of these seven years, which occurred in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities. He put in every city the food from the fields around it. 49 And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.</p><p>50 Before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph. Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore them to him. 51 Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. \u201CFor,\u201D he said, \u201CGod has made me forget all my hardship and all my father's house.\u201D[<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1247f\">f</a>] 52 The name of the second he called Ephraim, \u201CFor God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.\u201D[<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1248g\">g</a>]</p><p>53 The seven years of plenty that occurred in the land of Egypt came to an end, 54 and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 55 When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, \u201CGo to Joseph. What he says to you, do.\u201D</p><p>56 So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses[<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1252h\">h</a>] and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. 57 Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth</p></div></div></div></div></div>",

He took her and went in to her, 3 and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er. 4 She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan. 5 Yet again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. Judah[<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+38%3A1-30&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1125a\">a</a>] was in Chezib when she bore him.</p><p>6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 7 But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord put him to death. 8 Then Judah said to Onan, \u201CGo in to your brother's wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.\u201D 9 But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his. So whenever he went in to his brother's wife he would waste the semen on the ground, so as not to give offspring to his brother. 10 And what he did was wicked in the sight of the Lord, and he put him to death also. 11 Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, \u201CRemain a widow in your father's house, till Shelah my son grows up\u201D\u2014for he feared that he would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and remained in her father's house.</p><p>12 In the course of time the wife of Judah, Shua's daughter, died. When Judah was comforted, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 13 And when Tamar was told, \u201CYour father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,\u201D 14 she took off her widow's garments and covered herself with a veil, wrapping herself up, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she had not been given to him in marriage. 15 When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. 16 He turned to her at the roadside and said, \u201CCome, let me come in to you,\u201D for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, \u201CWhat will you give me, that you may come in to me?\u201D 17 He answered, \u201CI will send you a young goat from the flock.\u201D And she said, \u201CIf you give me a pledge, until you send it\u2014\u201D 18 He said, \u201CWhat pledge shall I give you?\u201D She replied, \u201CYour signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand.\u201D So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him. 19 Then she arose and went away, and taking off her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood.</p><p>20 When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite to take back the pledge from the woman's hand, he did not find her. 21 And he asked the men of the place, \u201CWhere is the cult prostitute[<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+38%3A1-30&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1141b\">b</a>] who was at Enaim at the roadside?\u201D And they said, \u201CNo cult prostitute has been here.\u201D 22 So he returned to Judah and said, \u201CI have not found her. Also, the men of the place said, \u2018No cult prostitute has been here.\u2019\u201D 23 And Judah replied, \u201CLet her keep the things as her own, or we shall be laughed at. You see, I sent this young goat, and you did not find her.\u201D</p><p>24 About three months later Judah was told, \u201CTamar your daughter-in-law has been immoral.[<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+38%3A1-30&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1144c\">c</a>] Moreover, she is pregnant by immorality.\u201D[<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+38%3A1-30&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1144d\">d</a>] And Judah said, \u201CBring her out, and let her be burned.\u201D 25 As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, \u201CBy the man to whom these belong, I am pregnant.\u201D And she said, \u201CPlease identify whose these are, the signet and the cord and the staff.\u201D 26 Then Judah identified them and said, \u201CShe is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.\u201D And he did not know her again.</p><p>27 When the time of her labor came, there were twins in her womb. 28 And when she was in labor, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, \u201CThis one came out first.\u201D 29 But as he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out. And she said, \u201CWhat a breach you have made for yourself!\u201D Therefore his name was called Perez.[<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+38%3A1-30&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-1149e\">e</a>] 30 Afterward his brother came out with the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.</p><p>\u00A0</p><p>\u00A0</p></div></div></div></div></div>",

They continued for some time in custody.</p><p>5 And one night they both dreamed\u2014the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison\u2014each his own dream, and each dream with its own interpretation. 6 When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were troubled. 7 So he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his master's house, \u201CWhy are your faces downcast today?\u201D 8 They said to him, \u201CWe have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them.\u201D And Joseph said to them, \u201CDo not interpretations belong to God? Please tell them to me.\u201D</p><p>9 So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him, \u201CIn my dream there was a vine before me, 10 and on the vine there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes. 11 Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand.\u201D 12 Then Joseph said to him, \u201CThis is its interpretation: the three branches are three days. 13 In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you shall place Pharaoh's cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his cupbearer. 14 Only remember me, when it is well with you, and please do me the kindness to mention me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house. 15 For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit.\u201D</p><p>16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, \u201CI also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head, 17 and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head.\u201D 18 And Joseph answered and said, \u201CThis is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days. 19 In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head\u2014from you!\u2014and hang you on a tree. And the birds will eat the flesh from you.\u201D</p><p>20 On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for all his servants and lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants. 21 He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand. 22 But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. 23 Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.</p><h3>Joseph Interprets Pharaoh's Dreams</h3><p>41 After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed...</p><p>\u00A0</p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule\" data-block-type=\"47\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1495563226365_69579\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><hr /></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1495563226365_69642\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><h2>Covenant Entrance Sunday</h2><p>As this was Covenant Entrance Sunday (a time Iron Works intentionally sets aside for baptisms and welcoming new members), below are some resources on the sacrament of baptism:</p><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ironworkschurch.org/featured-content-blog/2017/3/21/the-sacrament-of-covenant-baptism\">The Sacrament of Baptism</a></strong></p><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ironworkschurch.org/featured-content-blog/2017/3/21/who-should-be-baptizeda-covenant-dialogue\">Who Should Be Baptized?\u2014a Covenant Dialogue</a></strong></p><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chopministry.net/baptism-and-a-box-of-cornflakes/\">Baptism and a Box of Corn Flakes</a></strong></p><p>\u00A0</p><p>\u00A0</p></div></div></div></div></div>",

How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?\u201D 10 And as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her.</p><p>11 But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house, 12 she caught him by his garment, saying, \u201CLie with me.\u201D But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out of the house. 13 And as soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled out of the house, 14 she called to the men of her household and said to them, \u201CSee, he has brought among us a Hebrew to laugh at us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice. 15 And as soon as he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried out, he left his garment beside me and fled and got out of the house.\u201D 16 Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home, 17 and she told him the same story, saying, \u201CThe Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to laugh at me. 18 But as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment beside me and fled out of the house.\u201D</p><p>19 As soon as his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, \u201CThis is the way your servant treated me,\u201D his anger was kindled. 20 And Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison. 21 But the Lord was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. 22 And the keeper of the prison put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever was done there, he was the one who did it. 23 The keeper of the prison paid no attention to anything that was in Joseph's charge, because the Lord was with him.

Will you actually rule us?\u201D And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.</p><p>9 Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. \u201CListen,\u201D he said, \u201CI had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.\u201D</p><p>10 When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, \u201CWhat is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?\u201D 11 His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.</p><h3>Joseph Sold by His Brothers</h3><p>12 Now his brothers had gone to graze their father\u2019s flocks near Shechem, 13 and Israel said to Joseph, \u201CAs you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them.\u201D</p><p>\u201CVery well,\u201D he replied.</p><p>14 So he said to him, \u201CGo and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me.\u201D Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron.</p><p>When Joseph arrived at Shechem, 15 a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, \u201CWhat are you looking for?\u201D</p><p>16 He replied, \u201CI\u2019m looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?\u201D</p><p>17 \u201CThey have moved on from here,\u201D the man answered. \u201CI heard them say, \u2018Let\u2019s go to Dothan.\u2019\u201D</p><p>So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan. 18 But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.</p><p>19 \u201CHere comes that dreamer!\u201D they said to each other. 20 \u201CCome now, let\u2019s kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we\u2019ll see what comes of his dreams.\u201D</p><p>21 When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. \u201CLet\u2019s not take his life,\u201D he said. 22 \u201CDon\u2019t shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the wilderness, but don\u2019t lay a hand on him.\u201D Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.</p><p>23 So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe\u2014the ornate robe he was wearing\u2014 24 and they took him and threw him into the cistern. The cistern was empty; there was no water in it.</p><p>25 As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.</p><p>26 Judah said to his brothers, \u201CWhat will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? 27 Come, let\u2019s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.\u201D His brothers agreed.</p><p>28 So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels[<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+37&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-1112b\">b</a>] of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.</p><p>29 When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes. 30 He went back to his brothers and said, \u201CThe boy isn\u2019t there!

Yet you have said,&nbsp;\u2018I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.\u2019&nbsp;13 Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you in order to find favor in your sight.

Let no flocks or herds graze opposite that mountain.\u201D&nbsp;4 So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the first. And he rose early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, and took in his hand two tablets of stone.&nbsp;5 The Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord.&nbsp;6 The Lord passed before him and proclaimed,&nbsp;\u201CThe Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness,&nbsp;7 keeping steadfast love for thousands,&nbsp;forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty,&nbsp;visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation.\u201D&nbsp;8 And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped.&nbsp;9 And he said, \u201CIf now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, please let the Lord go in the midst of us, for it is a stiff-necked people, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.\u201D</p><p>10 And he said, \u201CBehold,&nbsp;I am making a covenant.

Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.&nbsp;22 Moreover, some women of our company amazed us.&nbsp;They were at the tomb early in the morning,&nbsp;23 and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.&nbsp;24 Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.\u201D&nbsp;25 And he said to them,&nbsp;\u201CO foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!&nbsp;26 Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?\u201D&nbsp;27 And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</p><p>28 So they drew near to the village to which they were going.&nbsp;He acted as if he were going farther,&nbsp;29 but they urged him strongly, saying, \u201CStay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.\u201D So he went in to stay with them.30 When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them.&nbsp;31 And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight.&nbsp;32 They said to each other,&nbsp;\u201CDid not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?\u201D33 And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,&nbsp;34 saying, \u201CThe Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!\u201D&nbsp;35 Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</p></div></div></div></div></div>",

That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and relenting from disaster. 3 Therefore now, O Lord, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.\u201D 4 And the Lord said, \u201CDo you do well to be angry?\u201D</p><p>5 Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, till he should see what would become of the city. 6 Now the Lord God appointed a plant and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant. 7 But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant, so that it withered. 8 When the sun rose, God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah so that he was faint. And he asked that he might die and said, \u201CIt is better for me to die than to live.\u201D 9 But God said to Jonah, \u201CDo you do well to be angry for the plant?\u201D And he said, \u201CYes, I do well to be angry, angry enough to die.\u201D 10 And the Lord said, \u201CYou pity the plant, for which you did not labor, nor did you make it grow, which came into being in a night and perished in a night. 11 And should not I pity Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and also much cattle?\u201D</p></div></div></div></div></div>",
